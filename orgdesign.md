### Course information
Dual B.Sc. in Law and Business Administration  
September 2020--January 2021

This course covers the principles of organizational structure and design. The class meets twice a week: **Wednesday, 16:15--17:45** or **18:00--19:30**, in **Room 7.1.08** for a tutorial session, and **Friday, 16:15--17:45**, for an online lecture.

Students form teams during the course in order to work collectively on class exercises and prepare a final project. This page includes basic instructions for the final project. Other course materials can be found on [Aula Global](https://aulaglobal.uc3m.es/course/view.php?id=112211).

## Final project

Teams of students must analyze a real-world company chosen from the list below. Each team should send two or three preferences to [{{ site.email }}](mailto:{{ site.email }}) as soon as possible after teams are formed. Companies will be assigned on a first come, first served basis.

> **Companies.** Accenture, Adobe, Airbus, Alibaba, Allianz Insurance, Amazon, American Express, Apple, Bain & Company, BMW, Bose, Boston Consulting Group, Build-A-Bear, BuzzFeed, Cisco, Costco, Delta Airlines, Deloitte, Diageo, Dropbox, Duolingo, Facebook, FedEx Corporation, Genentech, GoFundMe, Goldman Sachs, Google, Graduate Hotels, Hilton Hotels, Huawei, In-N-Out Burger, Instagram, Intel, KPMG, Lululemon, Marriot International, Nestle, Netflix, Nvidia, Oliver Wyman, Patagonia, Philips, Roche, Salesforce, Samsung, SAP, Slack, Snapchat, Southwest Airlines, Tencent, Tesla, The Cheesecake Factory, T-Mobile, Toyota, Uber, Ultimate Software, Volvo, Wal-Mart, Whole Foods Market, Xiaomi.

The team's analysis of the company must center on one of the topics covered by this course. This could be a chapter from one of the books in the bibliography (e.g. planning and control systems), a specific concept from one of these chapters (e.g. matrix structure), or a set of interconnected concepts (e.g. standardization of processes, outputs, and skills).

The project includes two deliverables:

1. A presentation of 10--12 min to be given during the last tutorial session (December 16). This should be structured in a way that allows the audience to understand the team's work. A presentation longer than 12 min will incur a grade penalty.
2. A written report of no more than five pages. This should focus on the team's conclusions and not describe the company. It must be typed in 12-point Times New Roman, double spaced. References, tables, and figures are not counted in the page limit. A report longer than five pages will incur a grade penalty.

Some additional instructions:

* Search for information beyond what is provided by the bibliography.
* All sources of information should be correctly cited in the report.
* Provide a clear overview of problems faced by the company and the context.
* Do not copy and paste information. Reports will be checked for plagiarism.
* Creativity is highly appreciated and generally results in better grades.
* Each team member is required to be familiar with the full content of the project.

Both presentation and report must be uploaded to [Aula Global](https://aulaglobal.uc3m.es/course/view.php?id=112211) no later than 24h before the tutorial on December 16. Each team should also bring a printed copy of the report to hand in during this session. Failure to deliver on time will result in a grade penalty.
