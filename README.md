# piazzai.github.io

This is the source code of my personal website, built using the [cvless](https://github.com/piazzai/cvless) theme for Jekyll. I use this website to host my CV and course materials.

The site's CSS is automatically sourced from the cvless repository. If you like the theme and want to use it, please read the installation and usage instructions in that repository. Cloning and editing this website is not recommended as it does not grant control over the CSS.
