# piazzai.github.io

These are the source files of my personal website, built using a stripped-down version of the [cvless](https://github.com/piazzai/cvless) theme for Jekyll. I use this site to link my profiles, host my CV, and occasionally, distribute course materials.

Because of its former inclusion in a fork network, this repository was lucky enough to be added to the 2020 GitHub snapshot for the [Arctic Code Vault](https://archiveprogram.github.com/arctic-vault) program. I apologize to posterity for the buggy code and self-promotion.
