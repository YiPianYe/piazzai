# piazzai.github.io

These are the source files of my personal website, built with the [cvless](https://github.com/piazzai/cvless) theme for Jekyll. I use it to link my profiles, host my CV, and occasionally distribute course materials.

Because of its former inclusion in a fork network, the repository was lucky enough to be added to the 2020 GitHub snapshot for the [Arctic Code Vault](https://archiveprogram.github.com/arctic-vault) program. While I am happy for the immortality this provides, I sincerely apologize to posterity for the buggy code and self-promotion.
