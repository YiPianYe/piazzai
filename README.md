# piazzai.github.io

This are the source files of my personal website, built with the [cvless](https://github.com/piazzai/cvless) theme for [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com). I use it to host my CV, draft documents, and course materials.

Because of a fork network, this repository was lucky enough to be included in the 2020 GitHub snapshot for the [Arctic Code Vault](https://archiveprogram.github.com/arctic-vault). I apologize to posterity for the buggy code and self-promotion.
