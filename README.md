# piazzai.github.io

This is the source code of my personal website, developed using the [CVLess](https://github.com/piazzai/cvless) theme for [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com). I use it to host my CV and, occasionally, temporary files and course materials.

The site's CSS is automatically sourced from the CVLess repository. If you like the theme and want to use it, please read the installation and usage instructions in that repository. Cloning and editing this repository is not recommended as it does not grant control over the CSS.
