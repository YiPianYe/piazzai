# piazzai.github.io

This are the source files of my personal website, built with the [cvless](https://github.com/piazzai/cvless) theme for [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com). I use it to host my CV, draft documents, and course materials. I added some icons to default cvless in order to customize the theme and make it suitable for an academic website. If you like those icons, feel free to use them in your own build.

Because of a fork network, this repository was lucky enough to be included in the 2020 GitHub snapshot for the [Arctic Code Vault](https://archiveprogram.github.com/arctic-vault). I apologize to posterity for the buggy code and self-promotion.
