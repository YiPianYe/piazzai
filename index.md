I am a researcher interested in problems of organization, strategy, and decision-making. Through computational and statistical models, I study how people use categorization to compete, coordinate, and make sense of products in markets.

My identity as a researcher is based on strong disciplinary training and a proclivity for interdisciplinary work. The most fascinating thing about human intelligence, I believe, is the mind’s ability to correlate its most disparate contents, establishing new and daring connections between seemingly distant areas of knowledge.

What draws me to academic research is my desire to build new connections that help filling the void between sciences, with particular regard to the social, mathematical, and computational sciences.
