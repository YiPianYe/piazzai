# About

I am a researcher interested in problems of organization, strategy, and decision-making. I develop statistical and computational models to study how the limits of human cognition affect people's behavior in markets.

I completed my PhD in the Applied Logic Group at [Delft University of Technology](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/) (2018) with a thesis on formal logics for product categorization. I am currently Assistant Professor of Management at [Carlos III University of Madrid](https://www.uc3m.es/), where I teach organizational design. My work is funded by the [State Research Agency](https://www.aei.gob.es/en) through a competitive Ramón y Cajal Fellowship (2023--2028, € 236 350).

My identity as a researcher is based on strong disciplinary training and a proclivity for interdisciplinary work. The most fascinating thing about human intelligence, in my view, is the mind’s ability to correlate its most disparate contents, establishing new and daring connections between seemingly distant areas of knowledge. What draws me to academic research is my desire to build new connections that help filling the void between sciences, with particular regard to the social, mathematical, and computational sciences. See [my CV](cv) for an overview of my work.

Whenever I am not working or entertaining my daughter, I read about typography and code things like [Jekyll websites](https://github.com/piazzai/cvless) and [LaTeX packages](https://github.com/piazzai/arguelles). I also regularly play online chess. Sometimes I do [research about chess](https://lichess.org/@/piazzai/blog) to figure out why I play so poorly.
