# About

I am a researcher interested in problems of organization, strategy, and decision-making. I develop statistical and computational models to study how the limits of human cognition affect people's behavior in markets.

I completed my PhD in the Applied Logic Group at [Delft University of Technology](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/) (2018) with a thesis on formal logics for product categorization. I am currently Assistant Professor of Management at [Carlos III University of Madrid](https://www.uc3m.es/), where I teach organizational design. My work is funded by the [State Research Agency](https://www.aei.gob.es/en) through a competitive Ramón y Cajal Fellowship (2023--2028, €236.350).

Whenever I am not working or entertaining my daughter, I read about typography and code things like [Jekyll websites](https://github.com/piazzai/cvless) and [LaTeX packages](https://github.com/piazzai/arguelles). I also regularly play online chess. Sometimes I do [research on chess](https://lichess.org/@/piazzai/blog) to figure out why I am playing so poorly.

My CV is available [here](cv). You can reach me at [michele.piazzai@uc3m.es](mailto:michele.piazzai@uc3m.es).
